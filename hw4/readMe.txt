Pseudo Code:
       fullAdderSum Function
         add three bits
       fullAdder Carry Function
         find the carry bit of three bits

       myAdd Function
         loop 32 times
	   extract pbit and qbit
	   add 3 bits
	   find carry of 3 bits
	   add bit to int

Diffifult:
	What I found most difficult was changing the bits in
the mySum int.

Plan:
	My approach was to do research on how I can loop 32 
times and change the bits in the mySum int.

Learned:
	I learned how to change bits in an int using an 
algorithm
