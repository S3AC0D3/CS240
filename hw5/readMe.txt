Counting sort is faster than quicksort
m = 10000
n = 10000

Quicksort is faster than counting sort 
m = 10000
n = 1000000000000

What I learned
     What I learned from the results is that sometimes counting sort
is faster than Quicksort and vise versa. The larger the array,
the slower counting sort is or I get a segmentation fault. It reduces
memory efficiency and increases space consumption. That's why it is 
not a good sorting algorithmn for a large range of numbers. Counting 
sort has a better time complexity but worse space complexity. All in all,
quicksort is a better choice for a sorting algorithmn when it comes 
down to a large range but then again counting sort is faster if it is
a small range.
