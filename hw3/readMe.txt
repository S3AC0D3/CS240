What I found difficult about this assignment was getting the reading the
correct size of the array because I kept getting a segmentation
fault. But i figures it out at the end. 

I planned my approach of it by seeing what the size of the array was and
computing how big it was.

What I learned after completing it is that the 0 index in an array is
part of the size of the array.
